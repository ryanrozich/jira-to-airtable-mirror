Recommendations for fixing these issues:

Add proper validation for the field mapping JSON structure
Implement timestamp standardization
Fix the retry decorator to properly use method_args
Add proper rate limit handling with exponential backoff
Implement batch processing for large datasets
Add health checks to the Docker container
Implement log rotation
Add comprehensive input validation for all configuration values
Implement proper error handling for API failures
Add validation for required field mappings during initialization
Would you like me to provide more details about any of these issues or help implement fixes for specific problems?
