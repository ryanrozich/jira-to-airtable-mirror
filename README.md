# Jira to Airtable Mirror

This service synchronizes Jira issues to an Airtable base. It can be run in multiple ways:
- As a local Docker container for development and testing
- As a scheduled AWS Lambda function for production use
- Directly on your local machine for development

The service periodically fetches issues from Jira and updates corresponding records in Airtable, maintaining a one-way sync from Jira to Airtable.

## Features

- Syncs Jira issues to Airtable on a configurable schedule
- Maps Jira fields to Airtable fields with customizable configuration
- Supports filtering Jira issues with JQL
- Syncs latest comments and tracks comment history
- Enhanced status change tracking and validation
- Runs as a containerized application (locally or in AWS Lambda)
- Uses AWS Secrets Manager for secure credential storage in Lambda
- Infrastructure managed with Terraform
- Automated deployment with Just command runner

## Prerequisites

### For Local Development
- Python 3.9+
- [Just](https://github.com/casey/just) command runner
- Docker (optional, for container-based development)

### For AWS Deployment
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials
- Docker installed and running
- [Just](https://github.com/casey/just) command runner
- Terraform installed
- AWS account with permissions for:
  - Lambda
  - ECR
  - CloudWatch
  - EventBridge
  - Secrets Manager
  - IAM

## Initial Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd jira-to-airtable-mirror
   ```

2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update with your credentials and configuration:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. Update the following variables in `.env`:
   - `JIRA_SERVER`: Your Jira server URL (e.g., https://your-domain.atlassian.net)
   - `JIRA_USERNAME`: Your Jira email
   - `JIRA_API_TOKEN`: Your Jira API token
   - `JIRA_PROJECT_KEY`: The project key to sync (e.g., PROJ)
   - `AIRTABLE_API_KEY`: Your Airtable API key
   - `AIRTABLE_BASE_ID`: Your Airtable base ID
   - `AIRTABLE_TABLE_NAME`: Your Airtable table name
   - `JIRA_TO_AIRTABLE_FIELD_MAP`: JSON mapping of Jira fields to Airtable field IDs

   Required field mappings for Jira to Airtable synchronization:
   ```json
   {
     // Required fields
     "key": "fldXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",      // Jira issue key (e.g., PROJ-123)
     "status": "fldXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",    // Issue status
     "summary": "fldXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",   // Issue title/summary
     "description": "fldXXXXXXXXXXXXXX", // Issue description
     "created": "fldXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",    // Creation timestamp
     "updated": "fldXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",    // Last update timestamp
     
     // Optional fields
     "reporter": "fldXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",   // Issue reporter
     "assignee": "fldXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",   // Assigned user
     "issuetype": "fldXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",  // Type of issue
     "parent": "fldXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",     // Parent issue (for subtasks)
     "resolutiondate": "fldXXXXXXXXXXXXXX", // When the issue was resolved
     
     // Update tracking fields (optional)
     "status_updated": "fldXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",  // Last time status changed
     
     // Comment tracking fields (optional)
     "latest_comment": "fldXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",  // Latest comment text
     "comment_author": "fldXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",  // Latest comment author
     "comment_updated": "fldXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",  // Latest comment timestamp
     
     // Custom fields (optional)
     "customfield_10016": "fldXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"  // Example custom field
   }
   ```

   Notes: 
   - Replace `fldXXXXXXXXXXXXXX` with your actual Airtable field IDs
     - For instructions on finding field IDs, see [Airtable's documentation](https://support.airtable.com/docs/finding-airtable-ids#finding-field-ids)
   - Required fields must be mapped for the sync to work properly
   - Optional fields will be synced if mapped, but can be omitted
   - Custom fields from Jira can be mapped using their field IDs (e.g., customfield_10016)
   - The sync process will fetch issues that have any kind of update (issue fields, status, or comments)
   - The `updated` field tracks all changes to an issue, while `status_updated` and `comment_updated` track specific types of changes

4. Validate your setup by running:
   ```bash
   just validate-all
   ```
   This will:
   - Verify all required environment variables are set
   - Test connections to both Jira and Airtable
   - Validate field mappings against the Airtable schema
   - Test data transformation with sample Jira issues
   
   If successful, you should see all checks pass with âœ… marks. If any checks fail, review the error messages and update your configuration accordingly.

## Sync Strategy

This tool uses an incremental sync approach with timestamp-based tracking to efficiently sync data between Jira and Airtable. Instead of performing full table scans on every sync, it:

1. Tracks the last successful sync time in Airtable
2. Uses Jira's `updated` field to query only for issues modified since the last sync
3. Automatically handles new field options by adding them to Airtable select fields when encountered

This incremental approach provides several benefits:
- Reduced API calls and rate limit usage
- Faster sync times
- Lower computational overhead
- Can be run frequently without performance impact

### How it Works

1. On each sync, the tool queries Airtable for the most recent `updated` timestamp across all records
2. It then queries Jira using JQL: `project = X AND updated > "last_sync_time"`
3. Only issues that have been modified (including field changes, status updates, and new comments) are processed
4. Each issue is upserted to Airtable, with new select field options added automatically if needed

This pattern ensures that syncs are efficient and can be run frequently to keep your Airtable data up to date.

## Local Development

### Option 1: Direct Python Development

1. Run the sync process:
   ```bash
   just run  # Run once
   # or
   just run-scheduled  # Run continuously on a schedule
   ```

   This will automatically:
   - Create a virtual environment if it doesn't exist
   - Install dependencies in the virtual environment
   - Run the sync script

2. Validate your setup:
   ```bash
   just validate-all  # Run all validation scripts
   ```

### Option 2: Local Docker Development

1. Build and run with Docker:
   ```bash
   just docker-build  # Build the image
   just docker-run   # Run the container
   ```

2. View logs:
   ```bash
   just docker-logs  # Follow container logs
   ```

3. Stop the container:
   ```bash
   just docker-stop
   ```

## AWS Lambda Deployment

### 1. Set Up AWS Resources

1. Create AWS Secrets:
   ```bash
   # Create Jira API token secret
   aws secretsmanager create-secret \
     --name jira-api-token \
     --secret-string "your-jira-token"

   # Create Airtable API key secret
   aws secretsmanager create-secret \
     --name airtable-api-key \
     --secret-string "your-airtable-key"
   ```

2. Copy and configure Terraform backend:
   ```bash
   cd terraform/aws
   cp backend.tf.example backend.tf
   # Edit backend.tf with your S3 bucket details
   ```

3. Create `terraform.tfvars`:
   ```hcl
   aws_region = "us-west-2"
   jira_server = "https://your-org.atlassian.net"
   jira_username = "your-email@example.com"
   jira_project_key = "PROJECT"
   jira_jql_filter = "project = PROJECT"
   airtable_base_id = "your-base-id"
   airtable_table_name = "Your Table"
   sync_interval_minutes = "10"
   jira_api_token_secret_arn = "arn:aws:secretsmanager:region:account:secret:jira-api-token-xxx"
   airtable_api_key_secret_arn = "arn:aws:secretsmanager:region:account:secret:airtable-api-key-xxx"
   jira_to_airtable_field_map = jsonencode({
     key = "fldXXX"
     summary = "fldYYY"
     # ... add other field mappings
   })
   ```

### 2. Deploy to AWS

1. Initialize Terraform:
   ```bash
   just terraform-init
   ```

2. Deploy the Lambda function:
   ```bash
   just lambda-deploy
   ```

3. Test the deployment:
   ```bash
   just lambda-invoke  # Trigger the function manually
   just lambda-logs   # View the logs
   ```
